✨ MetAssembly is a system to run WebAssembly workloads within Kubernetes ✨

## 🌞 Why

MetAssembly enables platform providers to eliminate the overhead of virtualzation
when running Kubernetes workloads, yet scale to a large number of pods on bare
metal. This is achievable by writing code in one of the many languages that have
support for WebAssembly, then compiling that code to WebAssembly. This is
particularly useful in core to edge applications where the platforms are
vastly different.
